      Welcome to Asahikawa. The 2020 IEEE International Conference on Real-time Computing and Robotics (IEEE RCAR 2020) will take place from August 2 to 6, 2020 in Asahikawa, Japan. 
      The objective of this conference is to provide a forum for researchers in robotics and real-time computing to share the latest results and to explore 
      the opportunity of research collaboration. With wide applications of robots in industry and services sectors, 
      real-time computing plays one of the major roles in various topics in robotics including real-time control, 
      human-robot interactions, sensor perception and fusion, robot intelligence, etc. 
      The scope of IEEE RCAR 2020 covers research, development and applications in the dynamic and exciting areas of real-time computing and robotics.

    Contributed Papers: Original papers are solicited in all related areas of intelligent control and automation. Full papers must be submitted in PDF format prepared strictly following the requirements for creating PDF documents. For detailed format information, please visit the conference website. All accepted papers will be included in the IEEE Xplore database and indexed by EI. 
    Tutorials & Workshops: Proposals for tutorials and workshops addressing new topics in Intelligent Autonomous Systems are invited for submission to the T/W chair.
    Journal Publications: Expanded versions of the accepted and presented papers with high quality will be invited for publication in the RCAR 2020 special issues in the selected leading international journals. 
    biomechanics, etc, and their applications.

    Asahikawa, located in the center of Hokkaido is the island's second largest city after Sapporo with a population over 350,000. Before the colonization of Hokkaido, Asahikawa was an important center of Ainu culture reflected in its museums and festivals. Asahikawa has a humid continental climate. In winter, it  is well known as the most coolest city in Japan (the recorded lowest temperature is ever −41℃). Summers in this city are generally warm but not humid. The average temperature in August is 17~22C°.  
    IEEE RCAR 2020 promises to be a great event for all participants, with excellent technical and social programs.

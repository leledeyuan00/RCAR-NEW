        <strong>Abstract:</strong>
        We have been working for Intelligent Spaces (iSpaces) which have functions of understanding environments by networking sensors and serving people by using Mechatoronics/Robotics devices. Many technologies have been applied to Intelligent Spaces, such as vision sensors, LRF, ultra sound sensors, electromagnetic sensors, and  other hardware to detect and track human and robots. Intelligent Spaces are good platforms to integrate many kinds of technologies. Integration itself is an important key to combine those technologies. 
In this talk I focus on new issues of Intelligent Spaces such as Energy, Transportation and Health Care. We are developing a new energy management system which is introducing mobile Energy Storage Devices with wireless energy transfer. And we are proposing a compact mobile vehicle to realize comfortable transportation in buildings. For health care problem we are working for measuring of human biometrics to get good sleep and reduce human stress.

        <strong>Title: Biomimetics on gecko locomotion: from Biology to Engineering</strong>
      </h4>
      <h5>
      <p>
        <strong>Abstract:</strong>
        Based on our previous study, the biomimetic fundamentals of the motion and control of the discontinuous-constraint linkage mechanism for the legged gecko-like robot are discussed. The key questions to be discussed here relate to the mechanics of the legged robot: motion coordination under a redundant driving condition, dynamics of the robot under impact contact, foot design with high adhesion, the effects of ground reaction forces on stability and moving efficiency, adhesive foot design and its micro-fabrication technique, and gait planning and control technology. Further development of the legged robot is suggested.

        <strong>Biography:</strong>
        Dr. Zhendong Dai is director and founder of the Institute of Bio-inspired Structure and Surface Engineering (IBSS) at Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics (NUAA). He is Professor of Astronautics, Mechanical Engineering, Mechanics, Materials Science and Engineering.
He set up a theory of tribo-irreversible thermodynamics and used the idea to understand coupling interaction among various factors by ENTROPY. In 2000, he jointed Grob’s biological group in Institute of Development Biology, Max-Plank-Institute, Tuebingen, Germany, where he learned the language of biology, and got feeling that what engineers may learn from biology and can do for biology. He designed the 3D sensors when he was in Germany
He attracted Prof. Sun from Beijing University and collaborated cordially, Dai and the staffs got training biological knowledge and learn to speak with biologist. He and Sun drawn a schedule for IBSS, and closely worked together in finding a way to stimulate animals locomotion, esp. gecko and pigeon, and by this way to understand how brain work during locomotion and how biological robot can be set up. 
	He was acutely aware the importance of reaction force in clearly understanding the locomotion, developed 3D force sensors and set up a facility to measure the 3D reaction force and to observe the motion behaviors simultaneously. He and his group find the different of reaction force pattern when gecko moving on floor, wall, ceiling and even various inclined surfaces, which greatly inspired the design of gecko-mimicking robots. The technology also be used for understanding the role of forelimb of frog during jumping, the behavior of locust when the incline changes. At the same time, the adhesive mechanism and the detaching technique used by gecko were subtly investigated; the adhesive structures mimicking setae were developed by self-growing carbon nanotube array technology, gecko mimicking adhesive elements and the robot were developed for the applications in space and vacuum.
	To meet the requirement of applications, such as light-weight load-carrying materials, heat-transferring, high-performance lead cell, electromagnetic shielding, many scientific questions and key technique were studied.
	Those works by he and his group are admitted by scientific and industrial societies, he has be pointed as boarding member of various journals, stand member of various academic societies. He has charged number of important projects, including two NSFC key projects and three key international collaboration projects. He has authored 6 books and more than 400 peer reviewed papers. 
	His research interests include biomimetic on legged locomotion —gecko-mimicking robot, biological gecko-robot, locomotion dynamics and artificial adhesive; lightweight structures and materials —bio-inspired lightweight structure, multifunctional foamed metal; and tribology.

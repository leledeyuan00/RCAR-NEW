        <strong>Abstract:</strong>
        We have been working for Intelligent Spaces (iSpaces) which have
        functions of understanding environments by networking sensors and
        serving people by using Mechatoronics/Robotics devices. Many
        technologies have been applied to Intelligent Spaces, such as vision
        sensors, LRF, ultra sound sensors, electromagnetic sensors, and other
        hardware to detect and track human and robots. Intelligent Spaces are
        good platforms to integrate many kinds of technologies. Integration
        itself is an important key to combine those technologies. In this talk I
        focus on new issues of Intelligent Spaces such as Energy, Transportation
        and Health Care. We are developing a new energy management system which
        is introducing mobile Energy Storage Devices with wireless energy
        transfer. And we are proposing a compact mobile vehicle to realize
        comfortable transportation in buildings. For health care problem we are
        working for measuring of human biometrics to get good sleep and reduce
        human stress.

        <strong>Abstract:</strong>
        Micro-robots have a great application prospect in the biomedical field
        due to the feature of small size. To solve the issues of energy supply
        and bio-compatibility of micro-robots, the bio-syncretic micro-robots
        actuated by living cells have been studied widely. However, the
        fabrication, assembling and control of the bio-syncretic micro-robots
        are the main challenges for the development of the bio-syncretic
        micro-robots. In this talk, manufacture and control of the living cells
        based modular micro robots will be discussed. Firstly, a robotic
        micro-manipulation system will be introduced to implement the
        high-throughput fabrication of the biological modules of micro robots,
        and to execute the on-line flexible assembling of the bio-syncretic
        robots by the fabricated living cells based modules. Then, an approach
        based on circularly distributed multiple electrodes (CE) will be induced
        to improve the differentiation of myoblast cells and characterize the
        electro-responsive beating behavior of living myotubes for the
        development of bio-syncretic micro robots. Moreover, a biomimetic
        bio-syncretic crawler actuated by living myotubes was demonstrated to
        move under the control of the CE. This talk will not only be related to
        the micro-robots, but will be also informative for biological tissue
        engineering and drugs screening.

        <strong>Abstract:</strong>
        Geckos have been studied for many years for their excellent moving
        abilities on various substrates, including any inclines, even ceilings,
        and various rough surfaces. Here we report our studies on the gecko
        adhesive mechanism, attaching and detaching dynamics, locomotion
        behaviors on anti-adhesive substrate and confined space, bio-inspired
        adhesive materials and gecko-inspired robot for micro-gravity condition.
        We have obtained following results: 1) The contact/ tribo-electrifiction
        is a mechanism more than Van der Waals force for gecko adhesion, we
        designed an experiment and measured the results showed the evidence of
        influence of contact / tribo-electrifiction on adhesion. 2) Gecko
        smartly uses technique of adducting and abducting to make attachment and
        detachment, this behavior inspired us to design a new pad for
        gecko-mimicking robot, instand of peeling from substrate. 3) Geckos
        developed positive and active synergy methods to overcome the difficult
        to move on anti-adhesive substrate. 4) We have developed bio-inspired
        adhesive materials and tested they performance for gecko mimicking
        robot. 5) Then we developed gecko-inspired robot for several possible
        applications.

        <strong>Biography:</strong>
        Dr. Zhendong Dai is director and founder of the Institute of
        Bio-inspired Structure and Surface Engineering (IBSS) at Nanjing
        University of Aeronautics and Astronautics (NUAA). He is Professor of
        Astronautics, Mechanical Engineering, Mechanics, Materials Science and
        Engineering. He set up a theory of tribo-irreversible thermodynamics and
        used the idea to understand coupling interaction among various factors
        by ENTROPY. In 2000, he jointed Grob’s biological group in Institute of
        Development Biology, Max-Plank-Institute, Tuebingen, Germany, where he
        learned the language of biology, and got feeling that what engineers may
        learn from biology and can do for biology. He designed the 3D sensors
        when he was in Germany He attracted Prof. Sun from Beijing University
        and collaborated cordially, Dai and the staffs got training biological
        knowledge and learn to speak with biologist. He and Sun drawn a schedule
        for IBSS, and closely worked together in finding a way to stimulate
        animals locomotion, esp. gecko and pigeon, and by this way to understand
        how brain work during locomotion and how biological robot can be set up.
        He was acutely aware the importance of reaction force in clearly
        understanding the locomotion, developed 3D force sensors and set up a
        facility to measure the 3D reaction force and to observe the motion
        behaviors simultaneously. He and his group find the different of
        reaction force pattern when gecko moving on floor, wall, ceiling and
        even various inclined surfaces, which greatly inspired the design of
        gecko-mimicking robots. The technology also be used for understanding
        the role of forelimb of frog during jumping, the behavior of locust when
        the incline changes. At the same time, the adhesive mechanism and the
        detaching technique used by gecko were subtly investigated; the adhesive
        structures mimicking setae were developed by self-growing carbon
        nanotube array technology, gecko mimicking adhesive elements and the
        robot were developed for the applications in space and vacuum. To meet
        the requirement of applications, such as light-weight load-carrying
        materials, heat-transferring, high-performance lead cell,
        electromagnetic shielding, many scientific questions and key technique
        were studied. Those works by he and his group are admitted by scientific
        and industrial societies, he has be pointed as boarding member of
        various journals, stand member of various academic societies. He has
        charged number of important projects, including two NSFC key projects
        and three key international collaboration projects. He has authored 6
        books and more than 400 peer reviewed papers. His research interests
        include biomimetic on legged locomotion —gecko-mimicking robot,
        biological gecko-robot, locomotion dynamics and artificial adhesive;
        lightweight structures and materials —bio-inspired lightweight
        structure, multifunctional foamed metal; and tribology.

        <strong>Abstract:</strong>
        Cable-suspended transportation is an important way of transferring goods
        and materials by rotorcrafts in complex and hazardous environments,
        where external disturbances, system uncertainties, and especially the
        "twofold" underactuated characteristic bring great challenges to
        realize safe and smooth deliveries. This talk discusses the latest
        research results on the dynamics analysis, motion planning, and
        nonlinear control of the quadrotor transportation systems. Specifically,
        based on Lagrangian mechanics, a precise model is set up for the
        “twofold” underactuated aerial transportation system. Then, a
        time-optimal motion planning technique is proposed to generate a
        minimum-time trajectory in consideration of state and control
        constraints. Finally, some nonlinear control algorithms are designed to
        achieve asymptotic stability, whose performance is verified by various
        experimental results.

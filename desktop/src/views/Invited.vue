        <strong>Biography:</strong>
        Hideki Hashimoto (IEEE Fellow, SICE Fellow, RSJ Fellow) received the B.S., M.S. and Dr. of Engineering from the Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Tokyo in 1981, 1984 and 1987 respectively. He joined the Institute of Industrial Science of the University of Tokyo as a lecturer in April of 1987. He was an associate professor from July of 1990 until March of 2011. He has been a professor at Dept. of Electrical, Electronics and Communication Engineering, Chuo University, Tokyo, Japan since April of 2011. He was a visiting scientist at LIDS (Laboratory for Information and Decision System) and LEES (Laboratory for Electromagnetic and Electronic Systems) of MIT from September of 1989 to August of 1990. He was an Invited Distinguished Professor at Seoul National University from 2009 to 2012, and a Visiting Professor at Budapest University of Technology and Economics from 2009 to 2011. He is a visiting professor at Budapest University of Technology and Economics from 2014. He was the founding general chair of 1997 IEEE/ASME International Conference on Advanced Intelligent Mechatronics (AIM). He was a program chair of IEEE/RSJ IROS in 1988 and 2000, and a general chair of IEEE ITS Conference in 2002 and IECON 2015. His research topics are Intelligent Space, Intelligent Systems, Mechatronics, Robotics and Control.

        <strong>Title: Biomimetics on gecko locomotion: from Biology to Engineering</strong>
      </h4>
      <h5>
      <p>
        <strong>Abstract:</strong>
        Based on our previous study, the biomimetic fundamentals of the motion and control of the discontinuous-constraint linkage mechanism for the legged gecko-like robot are discussed. The key questions to be discussed here relate to the mechanics of the legged robot: motion coordination under a redundant driving condition, dynamics of the robot under impact contact, foot design with high adhesion, the effects of ground reaction forces on stability and moving efficiency, adhesive foot design and its micro-fabrication technique, and gait planning and control technology. Further development of the legged robot is suggested.
